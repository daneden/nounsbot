# Nouns Bot

This is a Twitter bot which selects 2â€“3 nouns (and potentially verbs/adverbs)
from a list of about 1500 words, puts them together at random, and tweets the
newly-formed ideas.

Sometimes, the results are [quite
good](https://twitter.com/nounsbot/status/867772443603206146). Most of the time,
they are not.
